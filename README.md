# SirHoraceV
Sir Horace is a Discord bot for the official KOA server that is written in Javascript and Node.js and hosted using an Amazon Web Service Linux EC2 instance.

The function of the bot is to provide users with information about the community. This can be as simple as giving a definition on a community terms, such as Clans, or as technical as grabbing the next 5 events from the community Google calendar. It is also used to provide helpful links to the Habitica guild, Facebook Page, Goodreads group, and the official website. It also faciliates on-server functionality such as a pomodoro leaderboard.
